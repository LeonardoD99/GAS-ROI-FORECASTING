# GAS-ROI-FORECASTING
## Group 13

The project was developed in python with the aim of predicting gas price at different time horizons 30 days, 90 days, 180 days) using statistical machine learning techniques.

## Introduction

Natural gas is a source of energy that is used for heating, cooling, electricity generation, creating indispensable materials (such as steel and concrete) and more. Beeing labeled as a clean source of energy, natural gas plays an important role in the transformation of the worldâ€™s energy system, offering extensive advantages in dealing with global climate change. The reasonable and effective prediction of natural gas prices is helpful for companies and policy makers in commodity trading and power production planning, allowing them to make better decisions and establish effective risk-avoidance mechanisms. Natural gas price forecasting is critical to the energy market orientation, and it can provide a reference for policymakers and market participants.
